# Contributing to quic-zig

Thanks for your interest in quic-zig.

quic-zig is pre-1.0. It is a QUIC transport library for embedding,
interop work, and implementation research; 0.x releases may include
breaking API changes.

## Local Setup

The repository pins its toolchain with [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/).

```sh
mise install
zig build
```

`zig build` produces the QNS endpoint and the external interop helper.

## Tests

```sh
zig build test
zig build conformance
zig build conformance -Dconformance-filter='RFC9000'
zig build bench
```

`zig build test` runs unit, integration, conformance, QNS endpoint, and
deterministic fuzz-smoke coverage. `zig build conformance` runs the
auditor-facing RFC corpus directly. `zig build bench` runs the
microbenchmark harness.

## Interop

The external interop wrapper drives the official
[`quic-interop-runner`](https://github.com/quic-interop/quic-interop-runner).

```sh
zig build external-interop -- runner --dry-run
zig build external-interop -- runner --build-image
zig build external-interop -- runner --clients quic-go --tests H,D
zig build external-interop -- runner --role client --servers quic-go --tests H,D
```

See [interop/README.md](interop/README.md) for the full command surface
and generated-artifact locations.

## Style

- Keep one logical change per commit.
- Prefer existing module boundaries and helper APIs.
- Keep tests proportional to risk. Shared behavior, public APIs, and
  protocol invariants deserve focused regression coverage.
- Use RFC references in tests and comments when the behavior is driven by
  normative text.
- Keep public docs stable and usage-oriented. Investigation notes, local
  matrix snapshots, and scratch output should stay out of tracked docs.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests should include:

- A concise summary of behavior changed.
- The tests or interop commands run.
- Any known gaps or follow-up work.
- Notes about public API or wire-format compatibility when relevant.
